Hello world, I'm Mr. F(X)!

I have spent the last 10 years working and growing professionally in SaaS startups in and around the Silicon Valley area. The companies I have been a part of have raised over $160M of VC capital between them;

My stock options have been both worthless and valuable; I hope to check IPO off my list soon;

I have been hired as early as engineer #2 and as late as engineer #60.

I have been an engineer, a tech lead, a manager, back to an engineer, back to a tech lead, and back to a manager; I'll probably repeat this cycle again;

I have helped build an engineering department from 1 to 60+; I have introduced and taught Agile methodology to my teams; I have worked all-nighters, weekends, and holidays;

Basically, I have seen the good, the bad, the ugly, and the f*cking insane;

So, I just want to share some stuff I think I know;
