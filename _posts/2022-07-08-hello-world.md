Hello world, I'm [Mr. F!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIdy9_wqQw){:target="_blank"} :wave:

I have spent the last 10 years working and growing professionally in SaaS startups around the Silicon Valley area. The companies I have been a part of have raised over $160M of VC capital between them.

My stock options have been both worthless and valuable.

I have been hired as early as engineer #2 and helped build that engineering department to 60+.

I have been an engineer, a tech lead, a manager, back to an engineer, back to a tech lead, and back to a manager. I'll probably repeat this cycle again.

I have helped craft engineering hiring processes, ran many technical interviews, and onboarded dozens of engineers.

I have introduced and taught Agile methodology to my teams, ran 100s of sprints, and delivered dozens of projects on time.

I have seen the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insane, of life in a fast growling startup.

When I was younger and naive, I joined my first SaaS startup in search of, to quote the great Indiana Jones, "Fortune & Glory".

Now, I'm just here for the adventure :mountain:
