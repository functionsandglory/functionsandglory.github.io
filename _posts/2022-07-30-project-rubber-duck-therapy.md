I wanted to take a break from my other longer term projects and have some fun.

So I needed to come up with a "hackathon" project that would let me keep my React skills up to date (day job is Vue.js) and try out Next.js and Vercel.

I decided to build a "rubber duck" themed Eliza style chatbot.

The [Eliza algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is very simple. It simply takes the sentence provided by the user, restructures it, often as a question, and "messages" back. While primative by today's standards, at the time in the 1960's, many users were convinced of Eliza's intelligence.

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is the method of debugging code or problem-solving by describing the issue in spoken or written language to an inanimate object. The theory is that simply the act of describing the problem outside your mind, even to a person or thing that knows nothing about the subject, can trigger the insight you need.

Rubber duck debugging and Eliza seemed like a perfect combination!

I am pretty happy with the end result. I have never had the opportunity to build a chat/messaging UI before, which was a nice change of pace. Next.js and Vercel were incredibly easy to work with. I loved not needing to mess around with Webpack and having painless hosting and deploys out of the box.
