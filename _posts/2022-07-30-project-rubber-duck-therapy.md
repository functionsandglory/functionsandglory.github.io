I wanted to try out Next.js and Vercel to see what all the cool kids were talking about. A secondary goal was to keep my React skills up to date since my day job keeps me in Vue world.

I first needed a thing to build. I didn't have an appetite for a big project, but I wanted to do something different from the classic starter ToDo app. 

I decided to build an Eliza chatterbot themed as "rubber duck debugging".

The [Eliza algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is a simple and naive algorithm first created in the 1960's that takes a user's input and rephrases it back as a question to the user. The idea is to stimulate a conversation similar to how a therapist might.

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is a method of debugging code or problem-solving by describing the issue in spoken or written language to an inanimate object. The theory is that simply the act of describing the problem outside your head, even to a person or thing that knows nothing about the subject, can trigger the insight needed.

Turns out, Eliza and rubber duck debugging are the perfect combo for a chatterbot project, IMO.

So please, go chat with Dr. Bill Quack. He will dutifully lend you his ear, at any hour, night or day, free of charge!
