Hello world, I'm Mr. F! [ðŸ”ˆ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIdy9_wqQw){:target="_blank"}

I have spent the last 10 years working and growing professionally in SaaS startups in and around the Silicon Valley area. The companies I have been a part of have raised over $160M of VC capital between them.

My stock options have been worthless and my stock options have been valuable.

I have been hired as early as engineer #2.

I have been an engineer, a tech lead, a manager, back to an engineer, back to a tech lead, and back to a manager. I'll probably repeat this cycle again.

I have helped build an engineering department from 2 to 60+.

I have helped craft engineering hiring processes, run technical interviews, and onboarded dozens of engineers.

I have introduced and taught Agile methodology to my teams, run 100s of sprints, and delivered dozens of projects on time.

I have seen the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insane, of life in a fast growling startup.

When I was younger, I joined my first SaaS startup for "Fortune & Glory", to quote the great Indiana Jones.

While I may not have found fortune or glory yet, I stay for the adventure.
