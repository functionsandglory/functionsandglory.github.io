Hello world :wave:

I have spent the last 10 years working and growing professionally as a software engineer in SaaS startups around the Silicon Valley area. The companies I have been a part of have raised over $160M of VC capital between them.

I have worked on small teams, I have work on big teams, and I have worked on small teams that became big teams.

I have worked as an IC and I have worked in leadership roles.

I have seen the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insanity of life inside a fast-growing startups and scaleups.

This website simply serves as a place to share my musings and projects as they occur.
