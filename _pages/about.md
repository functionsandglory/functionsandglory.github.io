Hello world :wave:,

I have spent the last 10 years working and growing professionally as a software engineer in SaaS startups around the Silicon Valley area. The companies I have been a part of have raised over $160M of VC capital between them.

I have worked on small teams, I have work on big teams, and I have worked on small teams that became big teams.

I have worked as an IC and I have worked in leadership roles.

I have seen the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insanity of life inside fast-growing startups.

Over the course of my career, I would like to think I have learned a thing or two about building software products and teams that scale.

This website simply serves as a place to share my musings and projects as they occur.

Please feel free to reach out via email or social. I would love to talk shop :speech_balloon:.
